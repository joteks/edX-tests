Using command line arguements instead of reading input lines in main method extra credit

Using "getName()" instead of "myName()"

Recording age as a String instead of an int

Not including a greeting

Imprecise output: extra space, incorrect formatting, etc.

myName(), myAge(), and mySchool() methods are static

Tests fail if extra credit is not complete, make sure students know this

The greeting should be on its own line, and the required output should be after it
