## Local
The Local directory contains portable files for each project. To run tests on any of the projects: 
   1. Navigate to a project directory (ex. Local/AllAboutMe)
   2. Replace the example student work with the work you want to test (ex. replace StudentWork/AllAboutMe.java with your AllAboutMe.java file)
   3. Navigate back to the project directory and run Submission.sh

## Vocareum
These are copies of the files that run on the Vocareum website for each project.
